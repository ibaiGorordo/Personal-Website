I am a doctoral student at the Human-Function Substitution Systems Laboratory at the Kyushu Institute of Technology (Japan). My main interest is the development of sensors to improve people's quality of life, particularly to help the elderly and patients with chronic diseases.

Because of this, I am currently a doctoral student in "Life Science and Systems Engineering" at the Kyushu Institute of Technology (Japan) where I am researching on the development of a sensor system for balance analysis in daily life for the elderly.

In my daily work, I use mostly MATLAB and Python for data analysis and Machine Learning. I have experience using various sensors such as inertial sensors and millimeter Wave radars among others. Because of this, I am interested in sensor fusion, signal processing and Deep Learning.
