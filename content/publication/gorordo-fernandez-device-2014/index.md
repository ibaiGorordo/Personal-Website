abstract: "Currently devices for improving muscle coordination are mainly installed in hospitals and used for rehabilitation after an injury. These devices are relatively expensive and are not publicly available for a wide range of users. A simpler and cheaper device would enable more common use of neuromuscular training. Especially senior adults would benefit from this kind of exercise. The device presented in this study is designed for training of the biceps and shoulder muscles. The coordination improvement is obtained by applying controlled resistance which can be adjusted according to the needs of the individual user."
