	abstract = {Falls are a global health issue that especially affects to the elderly. In our previous research, we used a millimeter wave radar to estimate the position of the feet for fall risk assessment of cane users. Radar sensors have a good accuracy, however, due to its low resolution, it is difficult to know if the radar is really tracking the position of the feet or of any other object. In this research, we present a shoe image detector using SSD-MobileNet architecture that could be used in combination with the radar to accurately track the position of the feet. The results show that the proposed detector could correctly recognize the position of the shoes in an image.},

	abstract = {Base of Support (BoS) is a significant parameter for balance analysis. It is particularly important for people using assistive devices such as canes or walkers, because assistive devices improve the stability of the user by increasing the Base of Support. The objective of this research is to develop a wearable device that is able to analyze balance by measuring the position of the Center of Gravity (CoG) inside the Base of Support while using a cane. In this paper, we present our initial work to measure the Base of Support. We developed an instrumented cane with a millimeter wave radar in order to measure the Base of Support in real time. The point cloud data from the radar were grouped into clusters to identify the points belonging to each foot. A density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was used for this purpose. Finally, the right and left foot were differentiated based on the position of the centroid of each cluster. Knowing the position of both feet with respect to the cane, we were able to measure the BoS with an error of 92.04 cm2 (7.38 \%).},

	abstract = {Currently devices for improving muscle coordination are mainly installed in hospitals and used for rehabilitation after an injury. These devices are relatively expensive and are not publicly available for a wide range of users. A simpler and cheaper device would enable more common use of neuromuscular training. Especially senior adults would benefit from this kind of exercise. The device presented in this study is designed for training of the biceps and shoulder muscles. The coordination improvement is obtained by applying controlled resistance which can be adjusted according to the needs of the individual user.},

	abstract = {It is estimated that around 30\% of the elderly fall each year worldwide. The use of assistive devices such as canes or walkers increases the stability of the elderly by increasing the area of the Base of Support. However, the fall rate of assistive device users is similar or even higher than of non-device users. Feet position while standing has been found to be a relevant indicator of postural instability in elderly patients. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a sensor system that can measure the feet position of cane users during standing balance. The proposed system could be used for balance training of cane users by providing feedback about their stability level in real time. Previous studies used pressure plates or camera-based systems, such as using the Microsoft Kinect, to estimate the position of the feet during standing balance. However, these systems have various limitations. On the one hand, pressure plates are not affordable due to its high price. On the other hand, current camera-based systems do not work well for assistive device users because these systems cannot detect the position of the assistive devices. In this research, we present an instrumented cane with a millimeter wave radar (AWR1642, Texas Instruments) that can estimate the position of the feet with respect to the position of the tip of the cane. The system was tested in an experiment where 2 young subjects stand for 3 seconds while using a cane in 9 different foot positions. The proposed system was able to estimate the foot position with an RMSE value of 29.92 mm. Although this result is better than the 10 cm average error obtained in similar studies using the Microsoft Kinect, the proposed system requires further improvement to also measure the foot position for other activities such as walking or sit to stand motion.},

	abstract = {Optical motion capture and inertial measurement units (IMU) systems are the most common technologies for human motion capture. However, both of these echnologies have various limitations. Besides those technologies, other techniques such as magnetic motion capture are also used for position tracking. Magnetic motion trackers consist of two main elements: one magnetic source and one or several magnetic sensors. The transmitter generates a magnetic field by applying a current through a coil and the position and orientation are calculated by measuring the field strength in the receiver coils. Despite being easily affected by ferromagnetic materials, magnetic motion capture systems can provide position and orientation with high accuracy and are not affected by occlusion nor drift. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a cheap commercial electromagnetic tracker (Razer Hydra) by comparing the estimated 3D position with an optical motion capture system.},

	abstract = {Besides the several benefits of electromagnetic trackers, these devices have an important limitation, they are greatly affected by the magnetic disturbances in the environment. For this reason, in the past, several studies have developed different calibration techniques to improve the accuracy of electromagnetic trackers. Past studies concluded that a Neural Network based calibration produced better results than other commonly used calibration techniques. In those studies, the data was either collected manually using a regularly spaced grid with known coordinates or using another motion capture technique such as optical tracking. However, the first acquisition method is time consuming and provides a small dataset for the training of a Neural Network. On the other hand, the second method requires the use of an optical tracking system for every calibration. Here, we present a recalibration technique that uses a combination of both acquisition methods to reduce the error of the tracked position. First, a Neural Network is trained using a big dataset obtained with an optical motion tracking system.},
